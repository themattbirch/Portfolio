Marketers have been leveraging the power of color psychology for years, and you can apply some of their methods to help grow your business.

Use of color theory dates back to the days of traditional advertising, with agencies attempting to influence perception, drive behavior or set an agenda. And while different eras showcased different color schemes -- with bright, vibrant, accent colors being popular in the '70s, while the '90s saw a rise in the traditional red-black-white palette -- the methodology behind it remains the same.

There are a number of reasons why agencies use color and music to affect mood and drive behavior. The most powerful one is that they target the irrational portion of the brain, otherwise known as the limbic system. It operates quite differently than the prefrontal cortex, which handles judgement, and rational decision making. For example, if you send a proposal to a client, they might focus on the cost, because it's a set number, which can be measured.

But the limbic system is quite different, as it's focused on emotions and feelings. Marketers use colors, music and messaging to make consumers feel a certain way, attempting to influence them into taking action.

So what emotions are associated with colors? Read on to find out.

## How to use color theory to fit your business strategy

- Red

It's known that red attracts the eye more than any other color. Red is strong, and best utilized with muted, complementary colors, for proper contrast.

This color is viewed as safe. That's why pink is commonly used for beauty brands, and children's' toys.

- Blue

We see blue everywhere, as it's one of the most commonly used colors. It's seen as being calming and trustworthy, and it conveys a sense of security and loyalty. Finance and health companies leverage it, as do social media platforms.

Right on brand, green is believed to be environment-focused, with an eco-friendly appeal. Businesses that focus in health, wellness and nutrition niches tend to use it.

Boldness and sophistication is the name of the game here. Black, with the right font, can also be viewed as being elegant, so that's why fashion and media companies like it.

We can't forget about the most shiny color. Gold is popular for logos that attempt to display a sense of prominence, stemming from power and money. You'll see its use in the hospitality, resort and automotive niches.

Last but not least, silver doesn't have much impact on [color psychology](https://www.verywellmind.com/color-psychology-2795824), but it does look cool. It's modern, and automotive companies love it.
