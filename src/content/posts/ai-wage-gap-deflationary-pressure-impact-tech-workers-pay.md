title: "The AI wage paradox: how deflationary pressure will impact tech workers"

Both workers and the companies that employ them are witnessing a paradigm shift of epic proportions in the tech sector. AI capabilities are surging forward, and we're seeing a paradox emerge that challenges conventional wisdom about technology and wages.

And sure, tech innovations have historically driven up skilled worker wages, but this time feels different. It's clear there are early signals of a potentially deflationary impact on tech salaries–even as demand for AI expertise soars.

This isn't just another tech cycle. It's a fundamental shift in how value is created and distributed in our industry.

### Numbers Never Lie

The data shows a fascinating trend unfolding.

Early productivity gains are already remarkable, but these efficiency gains are creating unexpected ripple effects through the labor market. Recent economic modeling suggests market wages could experience significant pressure even as output soars, with some projections showing potential wage declines of up to 20-30% in certain tech roles over the next decade.

What makes this moment particularly significant is the trend acceleration. We're seeing productivity improvements that previously took years to achieve now happening in months.

And the output curves in recent economic analyses suggest they're not linear– but exponential–suggesting we're at the beginning of a major shift in how technical work is valued.

This [graph](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2023/12/Scenario-Planning-for-an-AGI-future-Anton-korinek) from the International Monetary Fund shows how an AGI-led future could impact wages (as well as growth), and it isn't good.

### Two Paths Diverging

In the traditional model for consulting work, AI simply augments human capabilities, leading to higher productivity and wages. This is much like how previous technological revolutions ultimately benefited workers.

But this time around, we're already experiencing what economists call the "AGI scenario"–where AI advances to the point of being able to handle complex cognitive tasks independently.

The implications of this second path can't be overstated. The path outlined above suggests a continuation of historical patterns where technology creates as many jobs as it displaces.

However, the AGI scenario points to a fundamentally different future. Companies can now achieve exponential productivity gains with linear or even declining headcount growth. This pattern does not track with the historical precedent we've become accustomed to.

### The Productivity Paradox

Productivity is rising dramatically while competitive market wages face growing pressure.

_Junior developers with AI assistance are already matching the output of senior developers–a democratization of capability that, counterintuitively, could lead to downward wage pressure across skill levels._

This capability shift is creating what we call the "productivity paradox." As individual workers become more productive, their scarcity value in the market decreases. This is already true in web development, where AI tools can now handle many tasks that previously required significant human expertise.

### Real-World Impact

Companies that previously needed ten developers can now achieve similar output with seven or eight, supported by AI tools. And this isn't just about headcount reduction. It's about a fundamental shift in how technical work is valued and executed.

The impact varies significantly across different types of technical roles. While AI specialists and system architects see their value increase, there's growing pressure on roles focused on implementation and maintenance. This bifurcation of the tech labor market could have lasting implications for career paths and skill development.

### Speed Of Change

The velocity of this recent transformation is hard to quantify.

Traditional economic models suggested these transitions would take decades, but we're seeing significant shifts in productivity and wage pressures over the past year alone.

This acceleration creates unique challenges for workforce planning. Teams need to balance the immediate productivity gains from AI tools against the longer-term implications for skill development and career progression.

### A Shift In How Capital Is Allocated

It's important to point out the recent shift in value creation: from labor to capital.

Companies that can effectively leverage AI capabilities are seeing their productivity soar while their labor costs remain stable or decline. This represents a fundamental change in the relationship between productivity growth and wage growth–a relationship that has historically been fairly tight in the tech sector.

### How To Approach Your Career Path

The most resilient careers will likely belong to those who can effectively partner with AI while developing unique human capabilities that complement rather than compete with automated systems.

It's all about being a copilot. Augmentation–not replacement.

### What's In Store For The Future

The implications of this shift extend beyond biweekly paychecks.

These structural changes impact how technical work is valued and compensated. And sure, top-tier AI specialists continue to command premium salaries, but there's growing pressure on middle-tier technical roles as AI tools become more capable
.
This trend suggests a potentially profound restructuring of the tech labor market. The traditional career ladder, where developers progress from junior to senior roles through accumulated experience, might need significant reimagining in an AI-augmented world.

## New Opportunities, Despite The Gloomy Outlook On The Surface

The recent trends and outlook for tech workers may seem gloomy, but they're also creating new opportunities. We're seeing developers pivot toward roles that focus on AI oversight, prompt engineering, and human-AI collaboration.

And the good news is that these areas are where human judgment remains critical. The key isn't to resist these changes but to adapt to them strategically.

Understanding this shift is crucial for everyone in tech—devs, stakeholders, team leaders, etc. The AI wage paradox isn't just an economic curiosity. It's a fundamental reshaping of how value is created and captured in our industry. As we continue to navigate this transition, staying informed and adaptable will be key to thriving in this new landscape.

My two cents: If you currently work in tech (or aspire to), spend time every week either learning about and/or working with AI.

Or risk getting left in the dust.
