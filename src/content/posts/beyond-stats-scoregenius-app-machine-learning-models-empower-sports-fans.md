Sports fans no longer watch the action singularly focused on goals and points.

Instead, these days, they're locked in on the "game within the game."

But the stats space has quickly become oversaturated, so they're often left drowning in numbers without insight. Box scores, advanced metrics, and endless highlights provide fragments—but rarely the cohesive picture needed to truly understand the game.

**ScoreGenius** bridges this gap, delivering actionable pre-game predictions through an easy-to-use Progressive Web App (PWA) that puts analytics in every fan's pocket.

## Predicting outcomes before games tip off

NBA teams invest millions of dollars in predictive analytics departments. ScoreGenius democratizes this advantage, synthesizing historical performance, team dynamics, and momentum metrics into clear predictions—all in under a second:

- **Daily Score Predictions:** Each NBA matchup receives a precise final score forecast generated by its ensemble of machine learning models.
- **Win Probability Rankings:** Instantly see which teams are outperforming statistical expectations based on historical results and advanced metrics.
- **Expected Margins:** Understand not just who might win, but by how large or small the margin will be.

These forecasts transform passive viewing into active engagement. Identify which underdogs have strong upset potential, which statistical mismatches might play out differently than conventional wisdom suggests, or which high-profile games might actually disappoint in terms of viewing experience.

All predictions, no bias.

## Advanced analytics forecast advanced outcomes

ScoreGenius distills complex basketball metrics into intuitive visualizations that drive deeper understanding:

- **Head-to-Head Form Analysis:** Track each team's momentum with recent performance trends visually represented.
- **Rest & Recovery Factors:** Quantified impact of schedule density and travel impact on expected performance.
- **Efficiency Metrics Dashboard:**
  - **Pace** (possessions per 48 minutes)
  - **Offensive/Defensive Rating** (points per 100 possessions)
  - **Four Factors** (eFG%, TOV%, ORB%, FT Rate)

See for yourself.

What makes ScoreGenius special is how these metrics are delivered. Fans get lightning-fast responsiveness without draining battery or data.

The app's technical infrastructure optimizes for performance at every level.

## Under the hood: The power of a strong ML pipeline

ScoreGenius isn't built on black-box algorithms or opaque methodologies. Its prediction engine combines proven statistical models with modern machine learning techniques:

```
DATA INGESTION → FEATURE ENGINEERING → MODEL TRAINING → ENSEMBLE PREDICTION → PWA DELIVERY
```

### 1. Data processing handled behind the scenes

ScoreGenius utilizes a powerful Python backend, which pulls comprehensive NBA statistics daily, including:

- Complete box scores with advanced metrics
- Team schedules and results
- Injury reports and lineup projections
- Contextual factors (back-to-backs, travel distance)

This data flows into a database, where it undergoes rigorous cleaning and normalization to ensure consistency across seasons and stat categories.

### 2. Features, not bugs

Raw statistics become predictive features through its transformation pipeline:

- Rolling averages across multiple timeframes (7-day, 14-day, 30-day windows)
- Team efficiency metrics normalized for pace and opponent strength
- Home/away performance differentials
- Rest-adjusted performance indicators

These engineered features capture team performance trends that traditional statistics often miss, providing its models with deeper contextual understanding.

### 3. Not your average model

ScoreGenius employs multiple model architectures in parallel:

- **Ridge Regression:** For stable baseline predictions with strong regularization
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR):** Capturing non-linear relationships between features
- **Ensemble Methods:** Combining individual model outputs for improved accuracy

Each model undergoes rigorous cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance against historical outcomes, with prediction error continuously monitored to ensure reliability.

### 4. How predictions are generated for users

Each morning, its pipeline:

1. Generates predictions for that day's games using the latest model weights.
2. Compiles results into lightweight JSON payloads.
3. Makes these predictions available through its API.
4. Delivers them to users via its React/TypeScript frontend.

This architecture ensures ScoreGenius' predictions and stats load in milliseconds, even on older devices or spotty connections.

## A privacy-first approach

In a world of intrusive apps demanding endless permissions and personal data, ScoreGenius takes a fundamentally different approach:

- **No accounts** required—ever
- **No personal data** collected or shared
- **No advertisements** or upsells
- **No notifications** or interruptions

Simply visit the [official ScoreGenius website](https://scoregenius.io) and read more about the app. If you like what you see, it takes only one click to add to your home screen for instant access. The PWA architecture means ScoreGenius works offline, updates automatically, and uses minimal storage space.

## Built for fans, by fans

SG's development philosophy centers on a single mantra: "For the sports fan, by the sports fan."

Every feature, from the clean stat cards to the intuitive navigation, emerged from real fan feedback and practical use cases. You won't find bloated menus or extraneous features, just the core predictive tools that enhance your connection to the game.

The engaging frontend delivers a responsive experience that feels native regardless of device, while the powerful backend powers the sophisticated machine learning pipeline that makes its predictions possible.
