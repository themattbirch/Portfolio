              Technical skill is only half the equation. My background in media
              and communication gives me an additional toolset—built on
              <span class="subtle-pulse text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 mx-4">
                empathy, collaboration, and awareness.
              </span>
              This balance allows me to not just write code, but to design and deliver
              products that feel human and create real impact.
