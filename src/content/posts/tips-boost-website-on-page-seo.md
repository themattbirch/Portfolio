# How to boost your website's on-page SEO

SEO has changed quite a bit over the years, and there are a lot of factors to monitor if you want your website to rank well.

Generally, the signals involved fall into two buckets: on-page and off-page SEO. Optimizing for the former is a far more technical process than for the latter, so we're focusing on that area in this post.

Off-page SEO tends to center around link building, authoritative mentions and citations, which you can acquire using a digital marketing agency. It's a process that takes time—months, years, even —depending on how competitive the search engine ranking positions (SERPs) are.

The title should be clear and concise, yet unique, so it stands out from the competition. Not only that, make sure to make it relevant to the content on the page.

- URL structure

Make sure to use the correct permalink structure. We advise everyone to stick to the "post name" URL structure on WordPress, which you can adjust in the "settings" area, as you can see in the screenshot below.

- Headings

HTML headings allow you to organize everything on a web page into a logical structure.
